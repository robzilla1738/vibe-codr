# Changelog

All notable changes to vibe-codr are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- **Standalone binary could not load any provider.** Provider SDKs were imported
  with a dynamic `import(variableSpecifier)` that `bun build --compile` can't
  bundle, so the "standalone" binary failed on every provider with
  `Cannot find module '@ai-sdk/...'`. Provider modules are now loaded through a
  static `import()` map, so the binary is genuinely self-contained (verified
  end-to-end against a live HTTP model and across all bundled providers).
- **Multibyte UTF-8 output corruption** in `bash` and background jobs: streamed
  output now uses one streaming `TextDecoder` per stream with a final flush, so
  a multibyte character split across a chunk boundary is no longer mangled.
- **Unhandled promise rejections** in the background-job output pumps are now
  caught and recorded on the job instead of escaping.
- **CRLF-authored `SKILL.md` / agent / command files** lost all frontmatter
  because the parser's fence regex was LF-anchored; line endings are now
  normalized before parsing.
- **JSONC config corruption**: a `//` or `/* */` inside a string value (a URL,
  path, or regex) was stripped as if it were a comment. Comment stripping is now
  string-aware.
- `glob` (1000-file) and `grep` (500-line) output caps now show an explicit
  truncation marker instead of silently dropping results.

### Improved
- **TUI interaction overhaul.** A recognized `/command` now turns the input bar
  green as a "registered" cue. Expanding a tool row keeps the clicked row in place
  (anchored scroll) instead of jumping to the middle. Clicking an assistant message
  folds its tool/output work away (just the prose remains), and **Ctrl+O** folds/
  unfolds every turn at once. Search rows truncate the query and show `N results`
  instead of a raw line count, and the system prompt now tells the model to search
  deliberately (no redundant reworded queries). The context rail is rebuilt as a
  clean live summary — **Activity** (in-progress tool feed, hidden when idle),
  **Subagents** (with one-line results), Tasks, Changed, then a compact Session —
  instead of a mostly-empty box.
- **Real context window & cost for any model.** Context window now resolves via a
  `config.contextWindow` override → a live Ollama `/api/show` probe (local + cloud)
  → the catalog → a 128k default, so local/cloud models report a real window. Cost
  is always shown: `$0.00` for free/local, and a `~$` estimate for models priced by
  a base-model catalog match (e.g. Ollama Cloud `glm-5.2`), with a per-model
  `config.pricing`/`contextWindow` pin taking precedence.
- **TUI palette & spacing.** The light lavender `#bb9af7` is now the single fixed
  brand hue across all chrome (header, rail, spinner, user gutter, plan box,
  menu); the **text-input area is the only region that recolors with the mode**
  (plan/execute/yolo) — switching mode no longer repaints the whole screen. Added
  a `gap={2}` gutter between the transcript and the context rail (message blocks
  no longer touch the rail) and a uniform `marginTop={1}` rhythm below the body,
  so the working line and footer no longer hug their neighbors.
- **System prompt** strengthened on the dimensions that drive output quality on
  real codebases: convention-matching, scope discipline, verification rigor, and
  concise terminal-appropriate communication.
- Removed a stale `outputs` entry from the Turbo `build` task (no more spurious
  "no output files found" warnings).
- Aligned optional-`AbortSignal` handling across the codebase.

### Tests
- Test suite expanded from 251 to 301 (line coverage ~86% → ~91.5%), adding:
  engine end-to-end and scenario tests (edit, plan, auto-verify self-correction,
  subagent delegation); robustness tests for imperfect-model behavior (non-unique
  edits, parallel edits to one file, failing commands, malformed args); a
  full-stack integration suite driving the real CLI against an in-process
  OpenAI-compatible server (file edits, JSON output, error handling, resume);
  and unit coverage for bash, ls, glob, grep, webfetch, loadAgents, parseModelsDev,
  and frontmatter parsing.
