# Changelog

All notable changes to vibe-codr are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- **Standalone binary could not load any provider.** Provider SDKs were imported
  with a dynamic `import(variableSpecifier)` that `bun build --compile` can't
  bundle, so the "standalone" binary failed on every provider with
  `Cannot find module '@ai-sdk/...'`. Provider modules are now loaded through a
  static `import()` map, so the binary is genuinely self-contained (verified
  end-to-end against a live HTTP model and across all bundled providers).
- **Multibyte UTF-8 output corruption** in `bash` and background jobs: streamed
  output now uses one streaming `TextDecoder` per stream with a final flush, so
  a multibyte character split across a chunk boundary is no longer mangled.
- **Unhandled promise rejections** in the background-job output pumps are now
  caught and recorded on the job instead of escaping.
- **CRLF-authored `SKILL.md` / agent / command files** lost all frontmatter
  because the parser's fence regex was LF-anchored; line endings are now
  normalized before parsing.
- **JSONC config corruption**: a `//` or `/* */` inside a string value (a URL,
  path, or regex) was stripped as if it were a comment. Comment stripping is now
  string-aware.
- `glob` (1000-file) and `grep` (500-line) output caps now show an explicit
  truncation marker instead of silently dropping results.

### Improved
- **System prompt** strengthened on the dimensions that drive output quality on
  real codebases: convention-matching, scope discipline, verification rigor, and
  concise terminal-appropriate communication.
- Removed a stale `outputs` entry from the Turbo `build` task (no more spurious
  "no output files found" warnings).
- Aligned optional-`AbortSignal` handling across the codebase.

### Tests
- Test suite expanded from 251 to 301 (line coverage ~86% → ~91.5%), adding:
  engine end-to-end and scenario tests (edit, plan, auto-verify self-correction,
  subagent delegation); robustness tests for imperfect-model behavior (non-unique
  edits, parallel edits to one file, failing commands, malformed args); a
  full-stack integration suite driving the real CLI against an in-process
  OpenAI-compatible server (file edits, JSON output, error handling, resume);
  and unit coverage for bash, ls, glob, grep, webfetch, loadAgents, parseModelsDev,
  and frontmatter parsing.
